# Epics and Stages

The story of TBG is broken into `Epic`s and `Stage`s.

`Epic`s are a larger story arc, and are made up of many `Stage`s.

An Epic will often require other Epics to be completed before a player can begin them.

Similarly, sometimes a Stage of an Epic will have a requirement, meaning the player will not be able to progress through the Epic until they meet that Stage's requirement.
