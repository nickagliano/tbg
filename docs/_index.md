# TBG Docs

This documentation is intended for __developers__, *not players*.

(Hopefully, at some point, there will be a wiki intended for players, but this is not it.)

Everythig here is subject to change. Every time I write a part of these concepts down, it changes.

A lot of this is just me rubber-ducking these concepts.
